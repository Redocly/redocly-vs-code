# Redocly OpenAPI VS Code Extension

## Release 0.2.0 (2022-01-13)

### Features

- Added interactive controls for the `tags` section.

- Added support for drag-and-drop reordering of list data in the cursor context panel. In this version of the extension, you can drag-and-drop elements in `servers` and `tags` sections to reorder them.

- Added **Go to root** button to the *Cursor context* panel for quick navigation from any section back to the root of the API document.

- The extension supports OpenAPI validation for `.json` files.

- Added support for value autocompletion in several types of fields:

  - `$ref` fields with `components` defined in the same file
  - fields of type `enum` and `boolean`
  - `default` and `example` fields that should have a predefined value from a sibling `enum` field 


### Fixes

- Implemented a number of stability improvements.
- Fixed issues with text editing via interactive control forms.
- The extension shows `Cursor context` icon and `RedoclyOpenAPI.openContext` command only for `yaml` language.

## Release 0.1.0 (2021-11-18)

### Features

- Added **interactive controls** for `info`, `server`, and `externalDocs` sections. To activate interactive controls, open the cursor context panel and place the cursor into any of the supported sections. The cursor context panel will show the visual OpenAPI editor where you can modify the contents of the supported sections directly. Your changes are immediately reflected in the API definition file.

- You can use the `htmlTemplate` option in your `.redocly.yaml` configuration file to style the look of the live documentation preview.

- The live preview panel automatically scrolls to the section of the API definition you're editing. More specifically, the following behavior has been implemented:

  - Editing a tag scrolls to the tag section
  - Editing a path item scrolls to the first operation in the path item
  - Editing an operation scrolls to the operation
  - Editing a schema scrolls to the first operation that uses the schema

### Fixes

- Implemented a number of performance and stability improvements.
- The autocompletion feature automatically switches to a new line if the selected item is not a scalar type. It also makes it easier to move to a new line on the same level as the current item by providing the `newLine` option in the suggestion dropdown.
- Improved the suggestions for the `referenceDocs` section of the `.redocly.yaml` configuration file.
- Root-level items in the suggestion dropdown are sorted according to the OpenAPI specification.

## Release 0.0.15 (2021-10-21)

### Features

- Added the *Go to...* option to fields in YAML files that contain a link to an internal file. Use this option to quickly access files in your project - for example, to open referenced API definitions directly from the `apiDefinitions` section in `.redocly.yaml`.

- Improved autocompletion and validation for the `.redocly.yaml` configuration file.

### Fixes

- Improved the performance of the documentation preview on first load.

- Internal improvements to YAML parsing.

----

## Release 0.0.14 (2021-09-16)

### Features

- Added a new panel called **Cursor context**, where you can learn more about OpenAPI objects and properties you're editing. Select the *Open cursor context* icon in the VS Code toolbar to open the panel. The descriptions in the panel are context-aware, and will change as you place your cursor into different sections of your OpenAPI document. 

- The live documentation preview feature requires an API key from Redocly. When you open the *Preview* panel, you will find the instructions for obtaining the key.

- Improved the performance of validation and autocompletion in all types of files, including OpenAPI documents, referenced files (linked with $ref in OpenAPI documents), and configuration files.

- Renamed the *Reference Docs* panel to *Preview*.

----
