# Redocly OpenAPI VS Code Extension

## Release 0.1.0 (2021-11-18)

### Features

- The extension now supports **interactive controls** for `info`, `server`, and `externalDocs` sections. To activate interactive controls, open the cursor context panel and place the cursor into any of the supported sections. The cursor context panel will show the visual OpenAPI editor where you can modify the contents of the supported sections directly. Your changes are immediately reflected in the API definition file.

- You can now use the `htmlTemplate` option in your `.redocly.yaml` configuration file to style the look of the live documentation preview.

- The live preview panel now automatically scrolls to the section of the API definition you're editing. More specifically, the following behavior has been implemented:

  - Editing a tag scrolls to the tag section
  - Editing a path item scrolls to the first operation in the path item
  - Editing an operation scrolls to the operation
  - Editing a schema scrolls to the first operation that uses the schema

### Fixes

- Implemented a number of performance and stability improvements.
- The autocompletion feature now automatically switches to a new line if the selected item is not a scalar type. It also makes it easier to move to a new line on the same level as the current item by providing the `newLine` option in the suggestion dropdown.
- Improved the suggestions for the `referenceDocs` section of the `.redocly.yaml` configuration file.
- Root-level items in the suggestion dropdown are now sorted according to the OpenAPI specification.

## Release 0.0.15 (2021-10-21)

### Features

- Fields in YAML files that contain a link to an internal file now support the *Go to...* option. Use this option to quickly access files in your project - for example, to open referenced API definitions directly from the `apiDefinitions` section in `.redocly.yaml`.

- Improved autocompletion and validation for the `.redocly.yaml` configuration file.

### Fixes

- Improved the performance of the documentation preview on first load.

- Internal improvements to YAML parsing.

## Release 0.0.14 (2021-09-16)

### Features

- The extension now supports a new panel: the cursor context, where you can learn more about OpenAPI objects and properties you're editing. Select the *Open cursor context* icon in the VS Code toolbar to open the panel. The descriptions in the panel are context-aware, and will change as you place your cursor into different sections of your OpenAPI document. 

- The live documentation preview feature now requires an API key from Redocly. When you open the *Preview* panel, you will find the instructions for how to obtain the key.

- Improved the performance of validation and autocompletion in all types of files, including OpenAPI documents, referenced files (linked with $ref in OpenAPI documents), and configuration files.

- Renamed the *Reference Docs* panel to *Preview*.
